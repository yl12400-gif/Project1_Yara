            <p>The NYU Abu Dhabi dining hall is where optimism seems to go to die — under the scorching desert sun,
                through menus that feel more like riddles than food listings, and behind the set of automatic doors
                that, ironically, often refuse to open automatically. The experience begins before you even step inside.
                Walking across campus in the midday heat already drains half your energy, and by the time you reach
                those stubborn glass doors, you’re questioning whether a meal is worth the trouble. Then, just as you
                push through with a little too much force, you’re greeted not with the refreshing smell of freshly
                prepared food but with an atmosphere of confusion and impatience.

                First, there’s the shock of heat that somehow manages to follow you indoors, clinging to your clothes
                and your skin. Then comes the mystery of the menu — a menu that changes often enough to feel
                unpredictable, but not in a way that sparks curiosity. Instead, it leaves students peering at signs,
                whispering questions to each other, and wondering what exactly counts as “Chef’s Special.” The rumors
                spread quickly: avocado eggs exist, avocado eggs are gone, avocado eggs were never real to begin with.
                By the time you’ve grabbed a tray and joined the line, there’s a quiet acceptance that whatever you
                hoped for probably won’t be served today.

                And then it hits — the small but devastating realization that neither flex dollars nor meal swipes apply
                here. The carefully rationed campus resources that got you through other meals are suddenly useless,
                leaving you fumbling for dirhams at the register. A simple lunch becomes an awkward negotiation between
                hunger and budget.

                Still, it’s all part of the freshman experience: a little chaos, a little confusion, and a lot of hunger
                — the kind of ritual that makes you laugh later, even if it makes you sigh now.</p>
